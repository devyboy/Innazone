## What's the Stalker Challenge?
The [Stalker Challenge](https://innazone.neocities.org/) is essentially spooky russian camping. It originates on the /k/ board of 4chan, where users would camp in abandoned/wooded areas and have certain tasks they need to complete. At the end of the challenge (if they make it out alive), their points are tallied up and internet clout is dispensed accordingly. The name is a reference to the [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video game series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) which takes place in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
